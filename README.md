# Tools and sources to explore Phase One digital backs, IIQ and calibrations

This project contain the sources of all the tools produced as a result of my explorations of Phase One digital backs. Unlike my explorations of Kodak cameras this one has not gone deep into firmware yet. For now it has tools to help analyzing IIQ files, extract some data from IIQ (internal digital back calibration file, build in profiles) and tools to do the remap of defective pixels without sending it to Phase One.

All software on this site is released free and under GPL license and in hope that it will be useful to other reverse engineers and Kodak camera explorers and users.

The following is the list of available utilities in source code and prebuilt for Windows/MacOS (Intel):

* [IIQ Utils](iiqutils) -  utility to dump contents of IIQ file (Phase One sections) in readable format, extract and dump calibration file etc.
* [IIQ Profile](iiqprofile) - COMING SOON
* [IIQ Remap](IIQRemap) - COMING SOON
[Profiles

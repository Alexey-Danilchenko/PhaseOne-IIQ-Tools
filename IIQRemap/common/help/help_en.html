<h1>IIQ Remap</h1>

<p>This software allows to perform defective pixels and
columns remap for Phase One digital backs. Currently supported
digital back models are Phase One Pnn/Pnn+ backs. Newer IIQ
backs may work as well but were not extensively tested.</p>

<h4><a href="#features">Skip to help on application features.</a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A few concepts</h2>

<p>In Phase One digital backs the sensor corrections of various kind
(smoothing, linearisation, defect remaps etc) are stored in special
calibration file. That file is written into every IIQ raw file by the camera
for the raw processing software to apply the corrections. This file can be
also uploaded onto digital back by Phase One Firmware Updater and this
can be leveraged to amend existing defects (add new defected pixels and columns,
remove one that no longer defective etc). This is the point of this utility -
to manage defects and produce an amended calibration file for uploading into
digital back. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remap procedure for Phase One Pnn+ backs:</h3>

<ul>
<li>On Phase One Pnn/Pnn+ digital backs based on Kodak senosrs the remap
    generally is better performed on dark frames (where people can see distinct
    defective columns when pulling the shadows or using high ISOs which on those
    digital backs are frequently software based). To perform a remap a dark shot
    raw file is needed. I would suggest a few shots at a different ISO with the
    closed lens cap at at 1/2 sec exposure and for Pnn+ backs also a few shots
    of couple minutes exposure (to trigger long exposure mode). To improve stability
    of a column remap, several dark shots can be combined - the IIQ Remap software
    can stack up to 7 raw files in a median stack leaving only stable defects in
    (this is most useful to detect bad columns).</li>

<li>Load up raw file or several raw files in a median stack</li>

<li>You can always create a back up calibration file by loading up raw IIQ File
    and saving calibration immediately - it will just save the calibration file
    from IIQ.</li>

<li><b>Columns remap:</b> adjust the exposure in a raw display tab to make the
    defects visible, use composite or grayscale raw display mode, switch on the
    column remapping mode and mark the defective columns with the mouse. I
    strongly recommend using grayscale raw display modes for manual dark frame
    based remaps. </li>

<li><b>Points remap:</b> these can also be done manually but it would be more
    effective to use "Apply defect corr." and then use adaptive auto remap with
    selected thresholds (more details below in the application help).</li>

<li>You can always validate the remap by selecting "Apply defect corr." (deselect
    it first if it was selected to refresh raw display) and untick all defects in
    defect selection section to see raw file clearly.</li>

<li>Repeat the procedure by loading abother dark raw or stack of them for the same
    digital back (remapped defects will be preserved across the load).</li>

<li>Save the caslibration file when satisfied (or intermediately to save remap results)</li>

<li>Use Phase One Firmware Update utility to upload calibration file to your back and
    enjoy the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course the above are only recommended procedure. You can use manual remaps with just
    about any file (if the defects can be clearly seen). The automatic remaps of defective
    points however will only work if the raw shot is uniform (i.e. roughly all of the same
    level - all dark or all grey or all white etc).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="features">The IIQ Remap application features</h2>

<p>The application functionality and controls is divided into two functional areas: one
    that has to do with raw file appearance and another that has to do with defects and remap.
    This can be seen on the two separate tabs to the left holding all the user interface for
    each of those areas in separate tab.</p>

<p>All the menus (except help) are duplicated with buttons on the right side of the main
    window so they will not be described here separately.</p>

<p>Most of the user interface elements have appropriate tooltips to make it easier to
    remember the functionality.</p>

<h3>Main window view</h3>
</div>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="page0_en.jpg"></p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<p>Toolbar contains buttons that control zoom levels (100%, Fit to Window, Zoom in, Zoom
    level selection and Zoom out) and manual defect mode selector buttons (columns remap and
    points remap and rows remap).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fit to Window zoom level is a bit different from commonly accepted. When selected, it will
    pick the largest zoom (from available list in drop-down) with which the raw file will fit
    into window. It will also change it when resizing. The reason it is done this way is that
    with specifics of raw display only the selected list of zooms allow to do it effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remap mode buttons are all mutually exclusive and will switch on the appropriate remap
    mode when the columns or points may be selected with mouse cursor and either set or unset
    as defective. The selected mode has to correspond to defects selection so it will be
    synchronised with those settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Status bar</h4>

<p>This is used to display some dynamic statistics - the row and column under mouse cursor,
    the R,G,B,G2 raw channel values for pixel under mouse cursor (if raw file is loaded) and
    the total counts of currently remapped defects for columns and points. The total defects
    count is affected by the defects selection settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Common buttons section</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Load RAW(s)</h4>

<p>Loads and displays single of multiple raw files. If multiple raw files are selected
    (up to 7), they all stacked into single raw file using median stack (to reduce noise
    and eliminate non stable defects).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Load Calibration</h4>

<p>Loads the external calibration file and defect remap from there. The raw file has
    to be loaded for this option tobe available. If the calibration file does not match
    up loaded raw file, then a message will be displayed and file will not be loaded.
    This option allows to load a previously saved calibration file instead using the one
    from the raw file and thus keep doing remap iteratively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Save Calibration</h4>

<p>Saves the remapped defects into calibration file. When saving for the first time and when
    calibration was not loaded from external file, a dialog asking directory to save file to
    will be presented. Calibration file is always saved with "back serial".calib file name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reset</h4>

<p>Discards the current calibration file contents and remapped defects and loads reloads calibration
    file from the raw file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="defects">Main window (Defects page)</h3>

<p>This page will become enabled when raw file is loaded. The full list if its settings and user
    interface elements is described in the following sections.</p>

</div>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="page0_en.jpg"></p>
</div>
<div class="content">

<h4>Clear selected defects</h4>

<p>This button will delete all the remap of all defects selected by defects selection checkboxes
    This may be useful to start remap of certain defects from scratch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Apply defects corr.</h4>

<p>This tickbox will apply current defects corrections to the raw file just as it would be when it is
    processed by any raw processing software. This action is static and only happens when tickbox is
    toggled or raw or calibration file loaded. So to trigger new remapped defects to be applied deselect
    this option and select again. Selecting this is crucial and mandatory for successful auto remap so
    always apply it first before proceeding with automatic remap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Defects Colour</h4>

<p>This button allows to pick the colours for displaying defects. The defects are always displayed
    on top of the raw file but this setting may come useful in different type of images (dark, light
    etc.) where a specific colour may be obscured by raw file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Defects selection</h4>

<p>This block of checkboxes allows to select what defects are currently displayed and being remapped.
    Deselecting the type of defects currently being remapped will also disable the remap mode (buttons
    in toolbar). The selection affects the defects count displayed in status line. This option is useful
    to reduce clutter and improve visibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Auto remap defect thresholds</h4>

<p>These define per channel thresholds used for defective points auto remap. The standard auto remap is
    performed by comparing the pixel values from the raw file to the calculated average value for the
    channel and marking it as defective if selected threshold is exceeded. If adaptive remap is selected,
    then the raw values are compared to a median value for the channel calculated within a block of pixels
    of selected size and marking it as defective if threshold for that channel is exceeded. The adaptive
    remaps works better in general so is recommended as a default method.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Adaptive remap</h4>

<p>Enables adaptive auto remap. Selecting this enables block size drop-down for adaptive remap as well.
    Adaptive remap will look at the raw image blocks of the indicated size and calculate median values
    for all channels for each block. The remap is then performed by comparing the raw values in the block
    against the medians to see if they are exceeding per-channels thresholds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Block size</h4>

<p>This drop-down allows selecting the block size (in pixels) for adaptive remap. The blocks have an
    even size and range from 4x4 to 64x64. Larger blocks will be less localised where the bigger sample
    may mean more accurate median. Smaller blocks are nevertheless effective for remap of standalone pixels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Detect from RAW</h4>

<p>Selecting this button attempts to default (or re-default) thresholds from loaded raw file. It will only
    work for uniform raw files (dark shots and the like).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Auto remap</h4>

<p>Pressing this button will perform standard or adaptive points auto remap according to the selected
    parameters. Auto remap is only effective for uniform raw files (dark, gray or white raw etc).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Currently loaded RAW statistics</h4>

<p>This shows statistics for loaded raw file channels - min, max and average values and the count of
    defects found that would be auto remapped with the current settings and suto remap methods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="raw_display">Main window (RAW Display page)</h3>

<p>This page will also become enabled when raw file(s) are loaded. The full list if its settings
    and user interface elements is described in the following sections.</p>

</div>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="page1_en.jpg"></p>
</div>
<div class="content">

<p>The first group of controls provides options that affect how the raw file is displayed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>RGB Render</h4>

<p>When selected the raw file is displayed using RGB rendering for each pixel. The missing colours
    are taken from neighbouring pixels in 2x2 pixel block thus making this effectively display large
    2x2 pixels (each 2x2 RGBG block ends up being of the same colour). It is very convenient to spot
    colour differences in pixels but not very useful for remap - since every defect will show up as
    2x2 block. For manual remap, I'd recommend to use it to spot defects and then witch to one of the
    other two methods to actually remap defects. Status bar in this mode shows the RGBG2 values for
    2x2 block not the pixel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Composite</h4>

<p>When selected the raw file is displayed using the pixel colour only. For Red the pixel will be red,
    for Green/Green2 it will be green and for Blue it will be blue. With all channels selected that may
    make defects more difficult to spot so this is good for remapping itself not for searching for
    defects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Grayscale</h4>

<p>It is essentially the same as composite but each pixel has all 3 components (R, G and B) set to the
    underlying pixel value. It is basically a composite mode displayed in grayscale. It is a compromise
    between Composite and RGB Render and can be used for looking for defects as well as remapping. It
    is best suited for remapping dark raw file defects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Channel selection</h4>

<p>These set of checkboxes allows to pick the raw channels to be displayed. The deselected channels are
    simply rendered black. The channels layout follow the Bayer pattern so columns and rows match those
    on a sensor (for easier de-selection of the even/odd rows and columns).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Gamma 2.2</h4>

<p>This enables gamma 2.2 correction applied to raw data and improves the display of the raw files (and
    a need to apply large exposure correction).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Black level zeroed</h4>

<p>This switches on a different method of applying black level. When selected the black levels are simply
    zeroed. I.e. each value up to selected black level in a channel is set to 0. When it is not selected,
    black levels calculated by traditional subtraction. This could be useful for spotting faint defective
    columns in dark frames for Kodak sensor based digital backs and is enabled by default.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>WB (from RAW)</h4>

<p>This button sets all per-channel exposure boost settings to white balance multipliers extracted from
    raw file (if none is specified, it uses daylight ones provided by LibRaw). This is absolutely useless
    for remap but good to have a for playing with the raw files and analysing post remapped raw (to make
    them look more natural).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reset Corrections</h4>

<p>Resets all exposure, contrast and black level corrections when pressed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Exposure Corrections</h4>

<p>This set of sliders and values controls exposure corrections. The values for these are indicated in
    stops and cover the range from -10 to +10 stops. The number values have more precision than sliders
    but setting the exposure with sliders is faster. The exposure correction can be done at individual
    channel levels and overall. These controls should be used to bring up the dark raw areas to a visible
    range and make a defects in certain channels more prominent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Contrast</h4>

<p>This section has two contrast related sliders. The Contrast slider controls level of contrast boost
    applied (steepness of the slope of S-curve). The Midpoint slider controls the middle point of contrast
    S curve. These controls should be used to make defect more prominent (and are quite useful for dark
    frame remaps).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Black levels</h4>

<p>These control set the black levels for each channel. They can be used to cut out the noise when boosting
    exposure on dark raw files. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Corrections order</h4>

<p>All the corrections are applied to the raw data in this order: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
black levels -&gt; gamma -&gt; exposure correction -&gt; contrast.</p>
